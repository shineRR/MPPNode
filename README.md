# MPPNode
# Client - Server
Develop a simple server-rendered application. For example, a list of tasks with the status of their completion, filtering by status and setting the expected completion date, as well as the ability to attach files to each task. The server must provide the client with the ready-made markup, and the data must be sent to the server through the form submission. It is mandatory to use NodeJS, specific libraries may differ. For example, Express + EJS will do.
